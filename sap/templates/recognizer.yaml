  You are an RTS game master tasked with analyzing and recognizing opponent strategy based on the summary game trajectory and provided parameterized framework.

  # Game Manual
  Here are the core rules and mechanics you need to follow: 
  This is a 2-player grid-based game where all units occupy 1x1 tiles. Each player controls units and can create more by spending a single resource type, which acts as money. The grid position coordinates range from 0 to map width - 1 or map height - 1.

  Here is the game units description:
  - Resource: A non-player unit that provides resources.
  - Base: 10 HP, costs 10 resources, and takes 250 time units to build. Can produce Workers.
  - Barracks: 4 HP, costs 5 resources, and takes 200 time units to build. Can produce Light, Heavy, or Ranged units.
  - Worker: 1 HP, costs 1 resource, takes 50 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy](1 damage), and harvest mineral.
  - Light Unit: 4 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 80 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] (2 damage).
  - Heavy Unit: 4 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 120 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] (4 damage).
  - Ranged Unit: 1 HP, costs 2 resources, takes 100 time units to build. Can [Attack Enemy] from 3 distance (1 damage, range 3).

  # Parameterized Strategy
  A strategy consists of several dimensions defined by specific parameters:

  1. **Economic Feature** focuses on how many workers to harvest in the game.
    - Parameter: Number of harvesting workers
    - Feature Space: {{1, 2}}

  2. **Barracks Feature** determines when to build barracks. You can construct barracks when resources are greater than or equal to a specific threshold (N), or not build them at all (False).
    - Parameter: Timing of construction (resource quantity trigger) or not building (False)
    - Feature Space: {{resource >= N, False}}, where 5 <= N <= 10.

  3. **Military Feature** outlines the strategy for combining different unit types used for attack or defense, specifying which units to produce.
    - Parameter: Combination of unit types, including Worker, Heavy, Light, Ranged.
    - Feature Space: {{Worker, Ranged and Worker, Ranged and Light and Worker, ...}}

  4. **Aggression Feature** indicates whether the player's strategy is inclined toward aggressive play (attacking) or defensive play (holding ground).
  - Parameter: Aggression
  - Feature Space: {{True, False}}  # {{Aggressive, Defensive}}

  5. **Attack Feature** define the target priority during an attack if the Aggressiveness Feature is set to True, focusing the military on attacking specific enemy unit types.
    - Parameter: Priority attack target
    - Feature Space: {{Building, Unit}}  # {{Attack Buildings, Attack Units (including Workers, Heavy, Light, Ranged)}}
  
  6. **Defense Feature** specifies the distance of the defense perimeter from the base, indicating where military units are deployed if the Aggressive feature is set to False.
    - Parameter: Distance from base
    - Feature Space: {{1, 2, 3, 4}}  # {{Close, Medium, Far, Very Far}}, you should output the integer value of the distance.

  # Example
  Here is a parameterized strategy example for your reference. You have to output the same format as the example:
  ## Strategy
  - Economic Feature: 2
  - Barracks Feature: resource >= 7
  - Military Feature: Ranged and Worker
  - Aggression Feature: True
  - Attack Feature: Building
  - Defense Feature: None
